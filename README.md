Day 8 of my LLM Journey – Building a Multi-Dataset Semantic Search Engine

Today, I went beyond simple keyword search and built a semantic search demo using embeddings + FAISS.
Instead of just matching words, it understands the meaning behind queries.

✨ What’s exciting:

Works on 4 datasets:
🔹 20 Newsgroups (~20k docs)
🔹 AG News (~5k news articles)
🔹 Amazon Polarity (~5k reviews)
🔹 Wikipedia (~5k entries)

Query examples like “doctor treating patients” → returns physicians, hospitals, nurses, medical stories.

Switch datasets instantly with a simple dropdown.

⚡ Applications:

Smarter knowledge bases

Enterprise document search

Customer support automation

Research exploration

This project made me realize how powerful embeddings are for real-world search problems
